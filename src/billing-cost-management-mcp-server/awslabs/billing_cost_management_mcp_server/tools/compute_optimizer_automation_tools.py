"""AWS Compute Optimizer Automation tools for the AWS Billing and Cost Management MCP server.

Provides a single MCP tool exposing Compute Optimizer Automation operations via an
`operation` dispatch parameter, matching the pattern used by compute_optimizer and
cost_optimization_hub in this package.

Compute Optimizer Automation lets customers implement Compute Optimizer recommendations,
either automatically via rules or on demand.

Compute Optimizer Automation is a regional service. Pass `regions` to query several
regions concurrently and merge the results; operations that return region-scoped data
(events, recommended actions, and their summaries and previews) stamp each item with its
region. With no `regions`, a single call targets the AWS_REGION env var or us-east-1.

@compute_optimizer_automation_server.tool(
    name='compute-optimizer-automation',
    description="""Retrieves data from AWS Compute Optimizer Automation.

Compute Optimizer Automation lets customers implement Compute Optimizer recommendations,
either automatically via rules or on demand.

USE THIS TOOL FOR:
- **Automation enrollment status** (is the account enrolled in Compute Optimizer Automation?)
- **Automation rules** (list/inspect rules that auto-apply recommendations, their schedules, criteria)
- **Automation events** (executions of a recommended action, their steps, status, and realized savings)
- **Recommended actions** already surfaced for automation (what a rule would/did act on)
- **Rule previews** (dry-run what a rule config would match before creating it)

DO NOT USE FOR:
- Compute Optimizer's raw per-resource rightsizing recommendations, e.g. "what EBS/EC2
  changes are recommended?" (use compute-optimizer)
- Cost savings / idle-resource recommendations across services (use cost-optimization)

Distinction: this tool covers the *automation* layer — rules, events, and the recommended
actions those rules operate on. It does not generate Compute Optimizer recommendations
itself; for those use the compute-optimizer tool.

**Regions:** Compute Optimizer Automation is a regional service. Omit `regions` to query a
single region (the AWS_REGION env var, or us-east-1). Pass `regions` as a list — e.g.
["us-east-1", "eu-west-1"] — to query those regions concurrently and merge the results: each
item includes its `region` and the response includes `regions_queried`. Duplicate entries are
collapsed. Account-global operations (get_automation_rule, get_enrollment_configuration,
list_accounts, list_automation_rules, list_tags_for_resource) accept at most one region —
rules are global resources, so fanning them out would repeat identical data.

Supported operations (pass via the `operation` parameter):

1. get_enrollment_configuration: Current Automation enrollment status for the account.
   Params: (none)
2. get_automation_event: Details about a single automation event (one execution of a
   recommended action). Params: event_id (required)
3. get_automation_rule: Details about a single automation rule, including its criteria
   and tags. Params: rule_arn (required)
4. list_accounts: Organization accounts enrolled in Compute Optimizer and whether they
   enabled Automation (management/delegated-admin only). Params: max_results, next_token
5. list_automation_events: Automation events matching filters (created within the past
   year). Params: filters, start_time, end_time, max_results, next_token
6. list_automation_event_steps: Steps for a specific automation event.
   Params: event_id (required), max_results, next_token
7. list_automation_event_summaries: Aggregated automation-event counts and savings.
   Params: filters, start_date, end_date, max_results, next_token
8. list_automation_rules: Automation rules matching filters.
   Params: filters, max_results, next_token
9. list_recommended_actions: Recommended actions matching filters.
   Params: filters, max_results, next_token
10. list_recommended_action_summaries: Aggregated recommended-action counts and savings.
    Params: filters, max_results, next_token
11. list_automation_rule_preview: Preview the recommended actions a rule config would
    match, without creating the rule. Params: rule_type (required),
    recommended_action_types (required), organization_scope, criteria, max_results,
    next_token
12. list_automation_rule_preview_summaries: Aggregated summary of a rule preview.
    Params: same as list_automation_rule_preview
13. list_tags_for_resource: Tags for a resource (e.g. an automation rule).
    Params: resource_arn (required)

Filter parameters (`filters`) are passed as a JSON string array of {name, values} objects.
Valid filter names by operation:
- list_automation_events / list_automation_event_summaries: AccountId, ResourceType,
  EventType, EventStatus
- list_automation_rules: Name, RecommendedActionType, Status, RuleType,
  OrganizationConfigurationRuleApplyOrder, AccountId
- list_recommended_actions / list_recommended_action_summaries: ResourceType,
  RecommendedActionType, ResourceId, LookBackPeriodInDays,
  CurrentResourceDetailsEbsVolumeType, ResourceTagsKey, ResourceTagsValue, AccountId,
  RestartNeeded

List operations paginate automatically up to max_pages (default 10, applied per region when
`regions` is passed). The returned `count` is the number of items in this response, not a
grand total. When more results remain, pass the returned opaque `next_token` string back
unchanged along with the same `regions` list it was produced with. A multi-region response
may also include `region_errors` ({region: structured error}) for regions that failed while
others succeeded.

Examples:
- {"operation": "get_enrollment_configuration"}
- {"operation": "get_automation_event", "event_id": "abc123"}
- {"operation": "list_automation_events", "regions": ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1"]}
- {"operation": "list_automation_events", "filters": "[{\"name\": \"EventStatus\", \"values\": [\"Complete\"]}]"}
- {"operation": "list_automation_rule_preview", "rule_type": "AccountRule", "recommended_action_types": "[\"UpgradeEbsVolumeType\"]"}""",
