    description="""Tool that describes Savings Plans inventory and purchasable offerings.

This tool provides visibility into what an account already owns and what it can buy through four
operations:

1. describe_savings_plans: The plans the account owns, with state, term, payment option, and
   expiry. Pass states to scope the result.
2. describe_savings_plan_rates: The rates on one Savings Plan the customer already owns.
3. describe_savings_plans_offerings: The offerings available to purchase.
4. describe_savings_plans_offering_rates: The rates for offerings available to purchase.

USE THIS TOOL FOR:
- **What plans an account owns** — including plans in the queued, returned, and payment-failed
  states, which Cost Explorer does not report on
- **When a plan expires or can still be returned** — the end and returnableUntil fields
- **The rates locked in on an existing plan**
- **What is available to purchase and at what rate** — to compare the rate one plan type, term, and
  payment option gets against another for the same usage

DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR:
- Coverage or utilization of existing plans, which is sp-performance
- Recommended savings plans to purchase, which is sp-recommendation

Tags come back on each plan in describe_savings_plans, so there is no separate tag operation.

IMPORTANT: the vocabulary here differs from Cost Explorer's, so values carried over from a Cost
Explorer response or recommendation will be rejected. See the individual parameter descriptions.

A large result from any of these operations is automatically offloaded to session SQL to save
tokens: the response carries data_stored=True and a table_name (one row per plan, rate, or
offering) instead of the inline list, and the rows are queried with the session-sql tool. A small
result is returned inline unchanged.""",

    Args:
        ctx: The MCP context object
        operation: The operation to perform: 'describe_savings_plans', 'describe_savings_plan_rates', 'describe_savings_plans_offerings', or 'describe_savings_plans_offering_rates'
        savings_plan_arns: The Savings Plan ARNs to describe as a list.
        savings_plan_ids: The Savings Plan IDs to describe as a list.
        states: The current states of the Savings Plans as a list. One or more of
            payment-pending, payment-failed, active, retired, queued, queued-deleted,
            pending-return, and returned. Omitting it returns every state, which for a mature
            account means mostly retired plans.
        savings_plan_id: The ID of the Savings Plan to describe rates for. Required for
            describe_savings_plan_rates.
        offering_ids: The IDs of the offerings as a list. Used by both offering
            operations.
        payment_options: The payment options as a list. One or more of 'No Upfront',
            'Partial Upfront', and 'All Upfront' — note the spaces. Used by both offering
            operations.
        plan_types: The plan types as a list. One or more of Compute, EC2Instance,
            SageMaker, and Database. Used by both offering operations.
        product_type: The product type — EC2, Fargate, Lambda, SageMaker, RDS, DSQL, DynamoDB,
            ElastiCache, DocDB, Neptune, Timestream, Keyspaces, DMS, or OpenSearch. Used by
            describe_savings_plans_offerings.
        products: The products as a list, from the same set as product_type. Used by
            describe_savings_plans_offering_rates.
        durations: The durations, in seconds as a list. A one-year term is 31536000
            and a three-year term is 94608000.
        currencies: The currencies as a list. One or more of CNY, USD, and EUR.
        descriptions: The descriptions as a list.
        service_codes: The service codes as a list. For
            describe_savings_plans_offering_rates these are AmazonEC2, AmazonECS, AmazonEKS,
            AWSLambda, AmazonSageMaker, AmazonRDS, AuroraDSQL, AmazonDynamoDB, AmazonElastiCache,
            AmazonDocDB, AmazonNeptune, AmazonTimestream, AmazonMCS, AWSDatabaseMigrationSvc, and
            AmazonES.
        usage_types: The usage types as a list.
        operations: The operations as a list.
        filters: The filters as a list of {"name": ..., "values": [...]} objects. The
            accepted names differ per operation: describe_savings_plans takes region,
            ec2-instance-family, commitment, upfront, term, savings-plan-type, payment-option,
            start, end, and instance-family; describe_savings_plan_rates takes region, instanceType,
            productDescription, tenancy, productType, serviceCode, usageType, and operation;
            describe_savings_plans_offerings takes region and instanceFamily; and
            describe_savings_plans_offering_rates takes region, instanceFamily, instanceType,
            productDescription, tenancy, and productId.
        next_token: The token for the next page of results. Paging is handled for you, so this is
            only needed to resume from a token a previous call returned.
        max_results: The maximum number of results to return with a single call.
        max_pages: The maximum number of pages to fetch. Omitting it fetches every page.
