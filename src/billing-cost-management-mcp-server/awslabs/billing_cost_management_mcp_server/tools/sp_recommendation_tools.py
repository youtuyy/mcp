    description="""Tool that retrieves AWS Savings Plans purchase recommendations using the Cost Explorer API.

This tool provides the commitment a customer should consider buying, and the evidence behind it,
through four operations:

1. get_savings_plans_purchase_recommendation: The recommended commitment for a given plan type,
   term, and payment option, with estimated savings, coverage, and utilization.
2. get_savings_plan_purchase_recommendation_details: The hourly data-points behind a single
   recommendation, keyed by the RecommendationDetailId returned above.
3. start_savings_plans_purchase_recommendation_generation: Recalculates the recommendation against
   the latest usage and the current Savings Plans inventory.
4. list_savings_plans_purchase_recommendation_generation: Generation history with status and
   timestamps.

USE THIS TOOL FOR:
- **What to buy** — the recommended commitment for a given plan type, term, and payment option
- **Whether that commitment would go unused** — the hourly EstimatedNewCommitmentUtilization behind
  the recommendation, rather than a figure derived from the raw spend series
- **How stale the recommendation is** — when it was last generated
- **A recommendation that reflects a purchase just made** — refresh it, since the stored one predates
  the purchase

DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR:
- What the customer already owns, which is sp-explorer
- Coverage or utilization of existing plans, which is sp-performance
- Modeling a commitment the customer specifies rather than a recommended one, which is
  sp-purchase-analyzer

ASYNCHRONOUS: start_savings_plans_purchase_recommendation_generation returns a RecommendationId and
an EstimatedCompletionTime, not a recommendation. Poll
list_savings_plans_purchase_recommendation_generation, filtered on that RecommendationId, until
GenerationStatus leaves PROCESSING, then read the refreshed recommendation with
get_savings_plans_purchase_recommendation. Completion time scales with the size of the billing
family, so read EstimatedCompletionTime rather than assuming a duration.

WRITE OPERATION: a consolidated billing family can refresh recommendations three times a day, and
only one generation runs at a time. Check the generation history before starting another — a
recommendation generated hours ago is usually fresh enough, and a refresh that fails leaves the
older recommendation in place with a timestamp that does not say so.

IMPORTANT: get_savings_plans_purchase_recommendation requires savings_plans_type, term_in_years,
payment_option, and lookback_period_in_days. None of them has a default — each changes the
recommended commitment, so the caller must choose. Recommendations are precomputed and may be
stale; the response carries the generation timestamp.""",

        payment_option: NO_UPFRONT, PARTIAL_UPFRONT, or ALL_UPFRONT. Required for get_savings_plans_purchase_recommendation. The API shape also accepts three
            LIGHT/MEDIUM/HEAVY_UTILIZATION values, which are Reserved Instance utilization levels and do not apply to Savings Plans.
        lookback_period_in_days: SEVEN_DAYS, THIRTY_DAYS, or SIXTY_DAYS. Required for get_savings_plans_purchase_recommendation.
        account_scope: PAYER or LINKED.
        filter: Filter recommendations by Account ID. Includes Dimensions only,

            not supported. Applies to get_savings_plans_purchase_recommendation only.
        recommendation_detail_id: Required for get_savings_plan_purchase_recommendation_details. Comes from the RecommendationDetailId field of a recommendation.

        recommendation_ids: Recommendation IDs to filter to.
        next_page_token: The token to retrieve the next set of results. Paging is handled for you,
            so this is only needed to resume from a token a previous call returned. A token belongs
            to the request that produced it and to the recommendation it was generated against, so
            it stops working once the parameters change or the recommendation is regenerated; read
            from the first page again when that happens.
        page_size: The number of results to return per page. Paging is handled for you, so this
            changes how many round trips it takes rather than how much comes back.
        max_pages: The maximum number of pages to fetch. Omitting it fetches every page.
